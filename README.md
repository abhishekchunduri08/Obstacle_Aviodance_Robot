# Obstacle_Aviodance_Robot

Obstacle avoidance is one of the most important aspects of mobile robotics. Without it , robot's movement would be very restrictive and fragile.
 This project explains obstacle avoidance using ultrasonic sensors, which allows robot to navigate smoothly in an unknown environment, avoiding collisions.
